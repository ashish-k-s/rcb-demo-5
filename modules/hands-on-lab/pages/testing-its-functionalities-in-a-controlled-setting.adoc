#  Testing its functionalities in a controlled setting

== Hands-on Lab: Testing the Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to test the functionalities of the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed in a controlled setting. This process will help you understand its capabilities and limitations, ensuring you can effectively utilize it for your RHEL systems.

### Prerequisites

1. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system with RHEL Lightspeed installed and configured.
2. Basic understanding of the RHEL command line.
3. Access to the internet or a proxy system for connecting to the RHEL Lightspeed service.

### Step 1: Setting up a Test Environment

Create a dedicated virtual machine (VM) or use an existing one for testing purposes. Ensure that this environment is isolated from your production systems to avoid any unintended changes.

### Step 2: Installing and Configuring the Command-Line Assistant

Follow these steps to install and configure the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed:

1. Update your RHEL system:

   ```
   sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
   sudo dnf update -y
   ```

2. Install the RHEL Lightspeed command-line assistant:

   ```
   sudo dnf install -y rhel-lightsspeed-cli
   ```

3. Configure the command-line assistant by following the on-screen instructions. You will need to register your system with RHEL Lightspeed and obtain an access token.

### Step 3: Testing Functionalities

Now that the command-line assistant is installed and configured, let's test its functionalities:

1. **Answering Questions:**

   Ask the command-line assistant a question related to RHEL configuration or troubleshooting. For example:

   ```
   rhel-lightsspeed-cli "How do I enable SELinux in enforcing mode?"
   ```

   The assistant should provide a clear, step-by-step response.

2. **Troubleshooting:**

   Describe a hypothetical issue you are facing with your RHEL system, and ask the command-line assistant for suggestions. For instance:

   ```
   rhel-lightsspeed-cli "My system is experiencing slow performance. What could be the cause
