#  Setting up a test environment for RHEL Lightspeed

== Hands-on Lab: Setting up a test environment for RHEL Lightspeed

To effectively demonstrate the capabilities of the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed, it's essential to set up a test environment. This hands-on lab will guide you through creating a controlled environment where you can install and configure the command-line assistant, and test its functionalities.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:

1. A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 system (physical or virtual)
2. Access to the Red Hat Customer Portal for downloading necessary packages
3. Basic knowledge of RHEL command-line interface (CLI)

### Step 1: Update your RHEL 10 system

Begin by updating your RHEL 10 system to ensure you have the latest packages and security patches. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo su -
# Update the system
dnf update -y
```

### Step 2: Register your system with Red Hat Subscription Management

Register your RHEL 10 system with Red Hat Subscription Management to access necessary repositories and packages. Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Register the system
subscription-manager register --username <your_username> --password <your_password>

# Attach your system to a subscription pool
subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
```

Replace `<your_username>`, `<your_password>`, and `<pool_id>` with your actual Red Hat credentials and pool ID.

### Step 3: Enable the necessary repositories

Enable the required repositories for installing the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Enable the AppStream repository
subscription-manager repos --enable=appstream

# Enable the BaseOS repository
subscription-manager repos --enable=baseos
```

### Step 4: Install the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed

Now, install the command-line assistant using the `dnf` package manager:

```bash
dnf install -y rhel-lightsspeed-cli
```

### Step 5: Verify the installation

Verify that the command-line assistant has been installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
rls --version
