#   Introducing RHEL Lightspeed for RHEL Systems

- **RHEL Lightspeed for RHEL Systems** is an AI-driven solution that enhances the management and troubleshooting of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems.
  - It includes a **Command-Line Assistant** powered by RHEL Lightspeed, which provides expert guidance to users.
  - The assistant can answer questions, offer troubleshooting steps, interpret log files, and suggest recommendations.
  - It leverages the WatsonX AI API's Large Language Model (LLM), deployed as a SaaS external infrastructure, to deliver accurate and relevant responses.
  - This tool is designed to streamline the configuration, management, and maintenance of RHEL deployments.
  - Users interact with the command-line assistant directly from the terminal, making it an integral part of the RHEL ecosystem.
  - RHEL Lightspeed can also be provisioned to RHEL deployments managed by Red Hat Satellite for broader system coverage.
